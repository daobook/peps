"Update the ``repr()``, ``str()``, and ``format()`` of the various Enum "

#: ../../pep-0663.txt:24
msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0663.txt:26
msgid ""
"The addition of ``StrEnum`` with its requirement to have its ``str()`` be"
" its ``value`` is inconsistent with other provided Enum's ``str``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0663.txt:29
msgid ""
"Having the ``str()`` of ``IntEnum`` and ``IntFlag`` not be the value "
"causes bugs and extra work when replacing existing constants."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0663.txt:32
msgid ""
"Having the ``str()`` and ``format()`` of an enum member be different can "
"be confusing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0663.txt:35
msgid ""
"The iteration of ``Flag`` members, which directly affects their "
"``repr()``, is inelegant at best, and buggy at worst."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0663.txt:40
msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0663.txt:42
msgid ""
"Enums are becoming more common in the standard library; being able to "
"recognize enum members by their ``repr()``, and having that ``repr()`` be"
" easy to parse, is useful and can save time and effort in understanding "
"and debugging code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0663.txt:46
msgid ""
"However, the enums with mixed-in data types (``IntEnum``, ``IntFlag``, "
"and the new ``StrEnum``) need to be more backwards compatible with the "
"constants they are replacing -- specifically, "
"``str(replacement_enum_member) == str(original_constant)`` should be true"
" (and the same for ``format()``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0663.txt:51
msgid ""
"IntEnum, IntFlag, and StrEnum should be as close to a drop-in replacement"
" of existing integer and string constants as is possible.  Towards that "
"goal, the str() output of each should be its inherent value; e.g. if "
"``Color`` is an ``IntEnum``::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0663.txt:63
msgid ""
"Note that format() already produces the correct output in 3.10, only "
"str() needs updating."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0663.txt:66
msgid ""
"As much as possible, the ``str()``, ``repr()``, and ``format()`` of enum "
"members should be standardized across the standard library."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0663.txt:69

"The repr() of Flag currently includes aliases, which it should not; "
"fixing that will, of course, already change its ``repr()`` in certain "
