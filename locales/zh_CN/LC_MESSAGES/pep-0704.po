"This PEP recommends that package installers like ``pip``  require a "

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0704.rst:24
msgid ""
"Python virtual environments are an essential part of the development "
"workflow for Python. However, they require extra effort since they are an"
" opt-in feature, and requires users to either:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0704.rst:26
msgid "take explicit steps to activate/deactivate a virtual environment"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0704.rst:27
msgid "use :samp:`{<path-to-venv>}/{<bin-path>}/{<executable>}` to run files"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0704.rst:29
msgid ""
"For new users, things will seemingly work correctly when virtual "
"environments are not used -â€” until they don't. Further, activating a "
"virtual environment uses slightly different syntax and mechanisms on "
"different platforms. This complicates the introduction to virtual "
"environments, since now information and context about how/why they are "
"useful needs to explained to justify adding additional steps to the "
"workflow."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0704.rst:31
msgid ""
"It also creates a scope for mistakes, since users need to remember to "
"activate the virtual environment before running an installer like ``pip``"
" or configure those installers to error out. On certain Linux "
"distributions, forgetting to do so can result in the installer modifying "
"files that are owned by the operating system (which is partially "
"mitigated by :pep:`668` for distributions that opt-in to marking their "
"environments accordingly)."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0704.rst:37
msgid ""
"Changing the default behaviour of installers like ``pip`` to require a "
"virtual environment to be active would:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0704.rst:39

"reduce the scope for accidental installation issues for all users by "
"default (by explicitly flagging when you're not using a virtual "
"environment)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0704.rst:42
msgid ""
"Setting up a convention of placing the virtual environment in-tree in a "
"directory named ``.venv`` removes a decision point for common workflows "

msgid "Backwards Compatibility"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0704.rst:70
msgid ""
"This PEP is backwards incompatible with workflows where users are using "

"This PEP requires that new users create and use a virtual environment to "

"<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages"
"/#creating-virtual-environments>`__ by the section on \"basics of how to "
"install Python packages\" in the Python Packaging User Guide, which "

msgid "Reference Implementation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0704.rst:95

"There is no reference implementation for this PEP. However, the proposed "
"behaviour is largely already implemented in ``pip`` and can be activated "

"Ideally, such a documentation page would explain what virtual "

"the most common shells and platforms."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This PEP creates a coupling between the behaviour of installers and the "
"Python version."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0704.rst:151
msgid ""
"This is already a rollout mechanism being used for behaviour changes in "
"the installation tooling. For example, ``pip`` on Python 3.11 will use "
"``importlib.metadata`` instead of ``pkg_resources`` for parsing/fetching "
"package metadata, and ``sysconfig`` instead of ``distutils.sysconfig`` "
"for getting the paths to unpack wheels into."

"The difference with those cases is that they're supposed to be largely "

"The primary benefit of this is that it allows for redistributors to adapt"
" their tooling in time for the new Python version and provides a clear "

"virtual environment by default (once Python 3.12 goes end-of-life)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0704.rst:157

"The primary issue with this approach is that it enforces a behaviour "
"change on users when they upgrade to a new Python version, which can "
"hamper the adoption of a new Python version. However, this is a "

"*some* changes will be needed for migration/upgrades."
