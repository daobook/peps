"When new modules were added to the standard Python library in the past, "
"it was not possible to foresee whether they would still be useful in the "
"future.  Even though Python \"Comes With Batteries Included\", batteries "
"may discharge over time.  Carrying old modules around is a burden on the "
"maintainer, especially when there is no interest in the module anymore."

"At the same time, removing a module from the distribution is difficult, "
"as it is not known in general whether anybody is still using it.  This "
"PEP defines a procedure for removing modules from the standard Python "
"library.  Usage of a module may be 'deprecated', which means that it may "
"be removed from a future Python release.  The rationale for deprecating a"
" module is also collected in this PEP.  If the rationale turns out "
"faulty, the module may become 'undeprecated'."

"Since the status of module deprecation is recorded in this PEP, proposals"
" for deprecating modules MUST be made by providing a change to the text "
"of this PEP."

#: ../../pep-0004.txt:39
msgid ""
"A proposal for deprecation of the module MUST include the date of the "
"proposed deprecation and a rationale for deprecating it.  In addition, "
"the proposal MUST include a change to the documentation of the module; "
"deprecation is indicated by saying that the module is \"obsolete\" or "
"\"deprecated\".  The proposal SHOULD include a patch for the module's "
"source code to indicate deprecation there as well, by raising a "
"DeprecationWarning.  The proposal MUST include patches to remove any use "
"of the deprecated module from the standard library."

"simultaneously, any module that exists in both Python 3.5 and Python 2.7 "
"will not be removed from the standard library until Python 2.7 is no "
"longer supported as specified by PEP 373. Exempted from this rule is any "
"module in the idlelib package as well as any exceptions granted by the "
"Python development team."

"When a module becomes deprecated, a rationale is given for its "
"deprecation.  In some cases, an alternative interface for the same "

"anymore."
